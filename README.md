To edit the actual report edit `/content/dla/_index.md` and write what you
want to write BELOW all the plusses at the top.

A push to main should generate changes that can be seen [here](https://nathanielnrn.github.io/hough-transform-documentation/)

Things should be written in [markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/) with a few caveats

## Images

Images should be inserted using

`{{ figure(src="img.png", alt="alt text", caption="caption text") }}`
with the file located in the `content/dla/` directory.


Rendering of math should work by just using $ and $$
